# Custom pretty prompt files

This is my repository where I store my Oh My Posh configuration files. You must have Nerd Fonts installed and Windows Terminal (only for Windows, of course) for this to work.

The theme itself is an edited version of the blue-owl theme, if you want that theme you can add to the configuration line in your profile (pwsh, bashrc, zshrc, others).

I'm also using the Terminal-Icons and PSReadLine modules for powershell (which is my favourite shell as I mostly use Windows). If I find how to replicate that FiSH behavior in other shells, that configuration will be included as well.
